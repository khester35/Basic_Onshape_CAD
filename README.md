# Onshape Assignments

This is an accumulation of my Onshape assignments and my thoughts on each one. Enjoy :)

### Caster 

#### Base

In this assignment, I had to make a rectangular extrusion with seven holes cut through it. It's the first part of the Caster Assembly. In Solidworks, this would have been very straightforward; my biggest struggle with this assignment was getting used to the new program. However, I soon realized that Onshape and Solidworks are very similar. I actually kind of like Onshape better! It's much more convenient: I created one document called "Caster" and just made a new part studio for the base. Hopefully that'll work so later down the line, I don't have a million different documents floating around.

#### Mount

The mount is a square face with five holes cut through it. This one was really easy, given that it's almost identical to the base. I shot through it with the skills I learned during the last assignment. 

#### Fork

![Fork](https://github.com/khester35/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/Images/Fork%20Screenshot.PNG)

The fork is a circular face with a cylindrical extrusion centered on one side and two mirrored, filleted (is that a word?) rectangles on the other. The mirror function was a little hard to work out at first, but I realized that I had just made a mistake when extruding the rectangles so once I fixed that, it was simple. The extrusions had some kinks, especially the rectangle, but once I really looked at them and found the similarities between this new thing and things I've done in the past, they were simple; for example, extruding the cylinder and rectangles was nearly identical to extruding the base and mount and the circular face of the fork. The fillet was exactly like how it was in Solidworks, so that's pretty self explanatory. All in all, the fork wasn't a very difficult assignment but I did get to mess around with some new features that I'm sure will come in handy later down the line. 

#### Tire

The tire had to be revolved, which isn't something I was very familiar with on Solidworks, let alone here. It took me a minute to figure out how to dimension the trapezoid; when you have a bunch of dimensions all over the place, it gets kind of confusing! It was interesting to see how much the little things matter. A millimeter of movement from your mouse can mean the difference between two entirely different things. Once I figured it out, which involved a lot of deleting and starting over again, I revolved it and it went pretty smoothly! I did the fillets with no problem and I'd like to say it turned out pretty good! 

#### Wheel

The wheel was another revolve and I think it took me the longest time to complete. I made a mistake in the dimensions at the beginning, so when I revolved it and tried to make the cuts later on, it interfered. However, I was able to fix it pretty quickly without messing up the work I'd done between the mistake and the faulty cut. I went back into the sketch and found the dimension that looked right, but wasn't. Again, when you have to dimension a lot of things, it gets confusing! But I changed it to the correct dimension and ta da! It was fixed. Then, the cuts looked perfect and the rest of the assignment was smooth sailing. 

#### Axle + Collar

![Axle + Collar](https://github.com/khester35/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/Images/Axle%20%26%20Collar%20Screenshot.PNG)

The Axle + Collar was interesting because I got to make two different parts within one part studio. I already found it impressive enough that I could make different part studios in the same document, but this went super quickly because of how convenient it was to make it. The axle was just a long cylinder with two notches on the end. The collar fit to the axle perfectly, which was way easier to do when I could just base it off of the axle itself instead of opening up something new and figuring out the dimensions without a reference. 

#### Bearing

![Bearing](https://github.com/khester35/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/Images/Big%20Bearing%20Screenshot.PNG)

The bearing is a cylinder with a wide hole cut through the center. This took no time at all; sketch, extrude, sketch, cut, and there we go. All done. 

#### Subassembly

![Subassembly](https://github.com/khester35/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/Images/Wheel%20%26%20Axle%20Subassembly%20Screenshot.PNG)

The subassembly consisted of the wheel and the tire. Mating in Onshape was rather difficult at first, but as soon as I stopped thinking about it as something new and instead began to make connections between Onshape and Solidworks, it became easy. I couldn't figure out how to mate the wheel to the origin for the longest time, but eventually, I managed. Then, I stuck the wheel and the tire together and it was a perfect fit! I'm glad that I got to do this subassembly first because it definitely prepared me for the Caster Assembly without sticking me in the mating deep end and telling me to swim. 

#### Caster Assembly!

Like I said earlier: I really like Onshape. I only made one document and it held seven part studios and two assemblies with no problem. Because of what I learned in the subassembly, the mates went smoothly! I had a little bit of rouble getting the pins to go directly into the holes on the collar but it didn't take me too long to figure out. Everything fit together really nicely and I think I might go back and change the colors to pretty it up a little. I learned a lot during this and I think it was a great exercise to introduce myself to Onshape. This assignment asks for a little bit of everything: extrusions and revolves, mates and fillets, and so much more. Now, I feel comfortable with this program in a way it took years to attain with Solidworks. 

### Dorothy's Dowel Pins

This assignment was certainly interesting. The videos were dense for sure but rather simple after a few rewatches. The assignment incorporated aspects of Onshape I was already familiar with (chamfers, extrusions, cuts, etc.) and put them together with the added challenge of configurations. Like most Onshape functions, configurations are much more convenient here than in Solidworks. I ran into my first speed bump when trying to mate the frame together. I had all of the dowel pins in the pieces of the frame when I discovered that one of holes was too close to the edge and actually ran through the frame. So, I had to mess around with the sketch to make sure that the dowel wasn't poking out at random points on the frame. The fix was easy and honestly, probably due to skipping steps the first time around; all I had to do was push the circles in the sketch closer together until that one didn't poke through. Then, I mated the frame together again but I noticed that there were places where they overlapped. I went back into the sketch, this time the sketch of the trapezoid, and adjusted the dimensions of the sides. The length was different between the configurations of the frame, but the sides could be the same without messing with that. So, I dimensioned one and made them equal. This carried over to the other configuration and fixed my problem in the assembly! 

### Onshape Challenge

#### Cube

![Cube](https://github.com/khester35/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/Images/Cube_SS.PNG)

The cube was pretty straightforward; I didn't really have any issues with it. I think that I could have extruded the cylinder on one or two of the faces and mirrored the rest, but I couldn't figure out how to do that without the mirrored cylinder being a strange distance away from the face of the cube. So, I figured I'd spend the extra time on the other two. 

#### Spinner Shaft

#### Bracket

![Bracket](https://github.com/khester35/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/Images/Spinner_Shaft_SS.PNG)

First, I extruded my sketch as a surface. Then, I used Thicken on the extrude. I dimensioned and extruded the holes first, then I filleted the edges. This is where I ran into my first problem. Even though I filleted the edges, they still had the sharp sides overtop of the newly curved ones. I found two ways to solve this: you can either extrude a cut through the sharp edges in the exact shape or you can hide the surface. Hiding the surface is both much simpler and it solves the second problem (which goes away in the assembly anyway): the holes don't cut all the way through the surface extrusion, just the thicken feature. This means that there was a thin layer overtop of my cuts and they didn't extend fully through the top of the extrusion. 

#### Onshape Challenge Assembly

This was what I had the most trouble with. At first, it was smooth sailing: I was able to mate the spinner shafts to the cube with ease. Then, when I went to mate the shafts to the bracket, the mates, for lack of a better term, broke. I couldn't get the shafts to mate properly on the cube and the bracket at the same time. It was either one or the other. I tried mating them in a different order and making small size adjustments on the individual parts. I was using revolute mates on everything and it turned out that was the problem. The only way to make it work was the use cylindrical mates on the shaft/bracket. Then, it was perfect!
