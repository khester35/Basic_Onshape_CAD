# Onshape Assignments

This is an accumulation of my Onshape assignments and my thoughts on each one. Enjoy :)

### Caster 

#### Base

In this assignment, I had to make a rectangular extrusion with seven holes cut through it. It's the first part of the Caster Assembly. In Solidworks, this would have been very straightforward; my biggest struggle with this assignment was getting used to the new program. However, I soon realized that Onshape and Solidworks are very similar. I actually kind of like Onshape better! It's much more convenient: I created one document called "Caster" and just made a new part studio for the base. Hopefully that'll work so later down the line, I don't have a million different documents floating around.

#### Mount

The mount is a square face with five holes cut through it. This one was really easy, given that it's almost identical to the base. I shot through it with the skills I learned during the last assignment. 

#### Fork

The fork is a circular face with a cylindrical extrusion centered on one side and two mirrored, filleted (is that a word?) rectangles on the other. The mirror function was a little hard to work out at first, but I realized that I had just made a mistake when extruding the rectangles so once I fixed that, it was simple. The extrusions had some kinks, especially the rectangle, but once I really looked at them and found the similarities between this new thing and things I've done in the past, they were simple; for example, extruding the cylinder and rectangles was nearly identical to extruding the base and mount and the circular face of the fork. The fillet was exactly like how it was in Solidworks, so that's pretty self explanatory. All in all, the fork wasn't a very difficult assignment but I did get to mess around with some new features that I'm sure will come in handy later down the line. 

#### Tire

The tire had to be revolved, which isn't something I was very familiar with on Solidworks, let alone here. It took me a minute to figure out how to dimension the trapezoid; when you have a bunch of dimensions all over the place, it gets kind of confusing! It was interesting to see how much the little things matter. A millimeter of movement from your mouse can mean the difference between two entirely different things. Once I figured it out, which involved a lot of deleting and starting over again, I revolved it and it went pretty smoothly! I did the fillets with no problem and I'd like to say it turned out pretty good! 

#### Wheel

The wheel was another revolve and I think it took me the longest time to complete. I made a mistake in the dimensions at the beginning, so when I revolved it and tried to make the cuts later on, it interfered. However, I was able to fix it pretty quickly without messing up the work I'd done between the mistake and the faulty cut. I went back into the sketch and found the dimension that looked right, but wasn't. Again, when you have to dimension a lot of things, it gets confusing! But I changed it to the correct dimension and ta da! It was fixed. Then, the cuts looked perfect and the rest of the assignment was smooth sailing. 

#### Axle + Collar

The Axle + Collar was interesting because I got to make two different parts within one part studio. I already found it impressive enough that I could make different part studios in the same document, but this went super quickly because of how convenient it was to make it. The axle was just a long cylinder with two notches on the end. The collar fit to the axle perfectly, which was way easier to do when I could just base it off of the axle itself instead of opening up something new and figuring out the dimensions without a reference. 

#### Bearing

The bearing is a cylinder with a wide hole cut through the center. This took no time at all; sketch, extrude, sketch, cut, and there we go. All done. 

#### Subassembly

The subassembly consisted of the wheel and the tire. Mating in Onshape was rather difficult at first, but as soon as I stopped thinking about it as something new and instead began to make connections between Onshape and Solidworks, it became easy. I couldn't figure out how to mate the wheel to the origin for the longest time, but eventually, I managed. Then, I stuck the wheel and the tire together and it was a perfect fit! I'm glad that I got to do this subassembly first because it definitely prepared me for the Caster Assembly without sticking me in the mating deep end and telling me to swim. 

#### Caster Assembly!

Like I said earlier: I really like Onshape. I only made one document and it held seven part studios and two assemblies with no problem. Because of what I learned in the subassembly, the mates went smoothly! I had a little bit of trouble getting the pins to go directly into the holes on the collar but it didn't take me too long to figure out. Everything fit together really nicely and I think I might go back and change the colors to pretty it up a little. I learned a lot during this and I think it was a great exercise to introduce myself to Onshape. This assignment asks for a little bit of everything: extrusions and revolves, mates and fillets, and so much more. Now, I feel comfortable with this program in a way it took years to attain with Solidworks.
